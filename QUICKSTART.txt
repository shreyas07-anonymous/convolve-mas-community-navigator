EXPECTED RUNTIME:
-----------------
- First run: ~1-2 minutes (downloads embedding model ~90MB)

WHAT TO EXPECT:
---------------

The demo demonstrates:

1. SEMANTIC SEARCH (5 scenarios)
   - "I lost my job and need help feeding my family"
     → Finds: Food banks, meal centers, garden programs
   
   - "Free medical checkup without insurance"
     → Finds: Community clinics, mobile units, dental care
   
   - "My landlord is trying to evict me unfairly"
     → Finds: Legal aid, housing services, shelters
   
   - "Want to get my GED and learn English"
     → Finds: Adult learning, ESL classes, education programs
   
   - "Struggling with depression and anxiety"
     → Finds: Mental health crisis line, counseling, support

2. MEMORY TRACKING
   - Search history with timestamps
   - User profile building
   - Pattern analysis (most searched categories)
   - Session persistence

3. PERSONALIZED RECOMMENDATIONS
   - Suggests resources based on search history
   - Filters out already-seen results
   - Adapts to user patterns over time

4. ADVANCED FEATURES
   - Category filtering
   - Relevance scoring (cosine similarity)
   - Metadata enrichment (hours, location, contact)
   - Memory export to JSON

TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

Issue: "ModuleNotFoundError"
Solution: Run: pip install -r requirements.txt

Issue: "Model download is slow"
Solution: First run downloads ~90MB embedding model. Be patient.
          Subsequent runs will be faster.

Issue: "Collection already exists"
Solution: This is normal if running multiple times. Demo still works.

Issue: "No internet connection"
Solution: After first successful run, the model is cached locally.
          You can run offline after that.
